# Debugging Sourcegraph AMI deployments

## Checking the state of the system

```sh
kubectl get pods -A
```

## Networking

If facing networking challenges, it can be helpful to run ping etc. from inside a container in the cluster rather than on the host machine:

```sh
kubectl run -it --rm busybox --image=busybox sh
```

## Checking storage provisioner logs

If there are disk / persistent volume issues, you can check the storage provisioner like so:

```sh
kubectl -n local-path-storage logs -f -l app=local-path-provisioner
```
